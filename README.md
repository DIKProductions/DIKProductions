- 👋 Hi, I’m @DIKProductions
- 👀 I’m interested in creating visual novels. Right now, I am a one man show, so I do all the scenes and rendering, script, coding, and everything else!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code with Python so that I can use Renpy to make my games.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Adult Visual Novels. I want to eventually create great visual novels that will teach history in a way that it has never been taught. I am doing AVN for now to get a feel for how the process works and while I learn 3D design and coding for Renpy.
- 📫 How to reach me? You can email contact@brokenfantasies.com - contact@dikproductions.com - or my personal emails: richie@brokenfantasies.com and richie@dikproductions.com
- DIK Productions is the company I set up to make all of my games. While Broken Fantasies will be developed separately, DIK Productions will publish the game. Going forward, DIK Productions will both develop and publish its own games!
